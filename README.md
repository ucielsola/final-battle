# FinaBattele - Alkemy's React Challenge by [Uciel Sola](https://ucielsola.com "Come see my portfolio!")

#### IMPORTANT! ‚ö†Ô∏è
The [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/) is having some internal issues, so in order to make this project work in local environment, you will need to enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin "Read about at MDN.org) in your browser! I recomend this browser extension to fix this:

- Chrome Extension [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino "For Chrome")
- Firefox Addon [CORS Unblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/cors-unblock/ "For Firefox")

## How does it works?
