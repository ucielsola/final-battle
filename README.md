# Final Battle - [Alkemy](https://alkemy.org "Official Site")'s React Challenge by [Uciel Sola](https://ucielsola.com "Come see my portfolio!") 

Here you can read the [Challenge's guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kNbni3fBBYiAErWYIQNmlggJTNHmLgPL/view "Read more...") üìú
##### Main Functions
- Search for your favourite heros and get all their data
- Create a balanced 6 members team, with 3 good heros and 3 bad heros.
- Edit your team

#### IMPORTANT! ‚ö†Ô∏è
The [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/ "Official Site") is having some internal issues, so in order to make this project work in local environment, you will need to enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin "Read more about CORS at MDN.org") in your browser! I recomend using this for that purpose:

- Chrome Extension [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino "For Chrome")
- Firefox Addon [CORS Unblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/cors-unblock/ "For Firefox")

## How it works üîß
- Login feature based on Challenge's guidelines. Built using [Formik](https://formik.org/ "Official Website") Forms, and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup "Official Repo") for validation.
- Fetching SuperHero data from the [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/ "Official Site") using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ "Official Website").
- Styling made with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Official Website").
- Animations with [Animate.css](https://animate.style/ "Official Website").
